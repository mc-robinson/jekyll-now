title: Excellent Profile of Doug Hofstadter
---

I recently came across James Somers' profile of Doug Hofstadter. The article finds a way to weave in so many important ideas of AI into a personal narrative that I have to consider it one of the best profiles I have ever read. Here are some of my favorite points:

On leaving biological analogies behind in modern machine learning:
<blockquote>“The quest for ‘artificial flight’ succeeded when the Wright brothers and others stopped imitating birds and started … learning about aerodynamics,” Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig write in their leading textbook, <i>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</i>. AI started working when it ditched humans as a model, <i>because</i> it ditched them. That’s the thrust of the analogy: Airplanes don’t flap their wings; why should computers think?</blockquote>
This, of course, has afforded us much progress recently due to now abundant data. The current approach of AI converts "the problem of unknotting a complex process into the problem of finding lots and lots of examples of that process in action." And, ..., "The technique is so effective that the Google Translate team can be made up of people who don’t speak most of the languages their application translates."

But what if this not really the right approach. Is, as Somers says, our own success stifling us?
<blockquote>As our machines get faster and ingest more data, we allow ourselves to be dumber. Instead of wrestling with our hardest problems in earnest, we can just plug in billions of examples of them. Which is a bit like using a graphing calculator to do your high-school calculus homework—it works great until you need to actually understand calculus.</blockquote>
And do we all deep down know this is just a useful convenient approach, but ultimately the quick, easy, and perhaps wrong approach?
<blockquote>This, then, is the trillion-dollar question: Will the approach undergirding AI today—an approach that borrows little from the mind, that’s grounded instead in big data and big engineering—get us to where we want to go?</blockquote>
After all, how far can data ultimately take us? As Peter Norvig acknowledges:
<blockquote>“We could draw this curve: as we gain more data, how much better does our system get?” he says. “And the answer is, it’s still improving—but we are getting to the point where we get less benefit than we did in the past.”</blockquote>
And for my favorite analogy of the article:
<blockquote>Perhaps, as Russell and Norvig politely acknowledge in the last chapter of their textbook, in taking its practical turn, AI has become too much like the man who tries to get to the moon by climbing a tree: “One can report steady progress, all the way to the top of the tree.”</blockquote>
That really is a great quote.

On a different note, interesting to learn some personal things about Hofstadter. I had no idea he was such an "outcast" in the modern AI field. He doesn't seem to have much interest in continuing to argue with these people:
<blockquote>Stuart Russell puts it bluntly. “Academia is not an environment where you just sit in your bath and have ideas and expect everyone to run around getting excited. It’s possible that in 50 years’ time we’ll say, ‘We really should have listened more to Doug Hofstadter.’ But it’s incumbent on every scientist to at least think about what is needed to get people to understand the ideas.”

“<i>Ars longa, vita brevis</i>,” Hofstadter likes to say. “I just figure that life is short. I <i>work</i>, I don’t try to publicize. I don’t try to fight.”</blockquote>
Hofstadter seems much like the latin figure, whose name escapes me, that remarked "my words will fly living among the mouths of men."

As for a final fun fact from the article: The value of IBM’s stock increased by $18 billion after Deep Blue won its famous chess match vs Garry Kasparov.

Also, the article pairs well with the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/daniel-dennetts-science-of-the-soul">excellent profile of Daniel Dennett that came out this spring:</a>
