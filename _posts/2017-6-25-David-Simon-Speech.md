I was re-watching some of season 5 of The Wire last night and randomly came across this speech by David Simon after some time on google.

I especially liked this Kafka quote he mentions that I had never come across before:

"You can hold yourself back from the sufferings of the world, that is something you are free to do and it accords with your nature, but perhaps this very holding back is the one suffering you could avoid."
