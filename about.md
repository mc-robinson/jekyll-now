This blog originally started out as `cutearguments.com`. That was the site where I collected my favorite articles, thought-experiments, mathematical proofs, logical arguments, etc.. That is to say, it is where I compiled those arguments/graphs/articles/metaphors I found especially 'cute,' in physics and math speak. 

I recently swithced over to hosting with github and changed the name in the process since too many people from outside of physics and math were confused by the meaning of 'cute.' Anyways, this blog is about way more than just clever scientific or mathematical statements, and `enthusiasm curbed` is still me (and probably a better description of my world view).   

If you find a nice argument or something that either curbs your enthusiasm or excites you, please send it along at the email below.
